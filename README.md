This is a starter project for:

* ApprovalTests in C++ - see [ApprovalTests.cpp](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp)
* Catch2 test framework
* CLion (and any other CMake-aware C++ build system)
* Visual Studio 2017 (`visual-studio-2017\StarterProject.sln`)
* Visual Studio 2019 (`visual-studio-2019\StarterProject2019.sln`)

Works on Mac, Linux and Windows.

## Machine Setup (Windows)

You can set up a machine from scratch by running the [PowerShell script: install.windows.ps1](install.windows.ps1). See the comments inside it for how to run it.

If you already have a Windows environment, but just not C++ tools, you can run the second half of that script.

## Starting Point

The tests in [NewTest](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.cpp.StarterProject/blob/master/tests/NewTest.cpp) should pass, and then you should delete/modify as needed to get started.
